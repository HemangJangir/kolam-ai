            Kolams (also called Rangoli) are living art traditions drawn each dawn on thresholds across South India. Dots and lines flow into patterns that invite auspiciousness, cultivate patience, and celebrate community.

            Every motif carries meaning: lotus for purity, conch for cosmic sound, parrots for companionship, and knots that symbolize continuity. As hands repeat curves daily, memory becomes geometry and devotion becomes design.
